# CS2 Calculator Library

## Overview
This is a C++ library that implements a simple calculator capable of performing a variety of mathematical operations, including:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Factorial calculation.
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM).
- Random number generation within a given range.
- Expression parsing and evaluation using the Shunting Yard Algorithm, supporting order of operations and parentheses.
The project is structured with multiple files and has been tracked using Git version control. It also includes a build system with CMake.
## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial, GCD, and LCM.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Can evaluate mathematical expressions using infix notation and parentheses.
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates random numbers within a specified range.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases such as division by zero and negative factorials.
## Requirements
- C++11 or higher
- CMake for build management
- g++ for compilation
